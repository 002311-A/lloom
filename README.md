# LLooM

> NOTE: repo documentation in progress

**LLooM** is a Python package introduced as part of an ACM CHI 2024 paper:

**Concept Induction: Analyzing Unstructured Text with High-Level Concepts Using LLooM**. *Michelle S. Lam, Janice Teoh, James Landay, Jeffrey Heer, Michael S. Bernstein*. Proceedings of the 2024 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '24).

## Get started
Follow the [**Get Started**](https://michelle123lam.github.io/lloom/about/get-started) instructions on our documentation for a walkthrough of the main LLooM functions.

This will involve downloading our Python package, available on PyPI as [`text_lloom`](https://pypi.org/project/text_lloom/). We recommend setting up a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) or [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands).
```sh
pip install text_lloom
```

## Development setup
TODO: add local development setup instructions

## Contact
LLooM is a research prototype and still under active development! Feel free to reach out to Michelle Lam at mlam4@cs.stanford.edu if you have questions, run into issues, or want to contribute.
