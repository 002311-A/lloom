# LLooM Examples

LLooM can assist with a range of data analysis goalsâ€”from preliminary exploratory analysis to theory-driven confirmatory analysis. Analysts can review LLooM concepts to interpret emergent trends in the data, but they can also author and edit concepts to actively seek out certain phenomena in the data. Concepts can be compared with existing metadata or other concepts to calculate statistics, generate plots, or train a model.
